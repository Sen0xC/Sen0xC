# Python games
this projext is an university project on which we needed to do 3-4 games on python the games are the following :
- tic tac toe
- guessing game
- matchstick game
- Connect 4

the last game (Connect 4) was a bonus, with my teamate we didn't get the time to do it so we just have the 3rd first.
On this project we needed to do all the game and also the graphic's part, a menu to navigate, a system to keep the scores during the time that the game is started.
I don't find this project on my folders so I can't show you any screen of it.

We had a second project linked with the python's game, it was to do some bots for all the games that we did before so we needed to do a bot for tic tac toe, guessing game, and matchstick game.
our bot was like a player which play randomly, before the bot play he verifi if can play (for example on the game tic tac toe if the player which play before, the bot need to verify where the player put his token)
